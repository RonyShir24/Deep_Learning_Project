## ðŸ“š Project 1: Fully Connected Neural Network on MNIST

**Objective**: Build and evaluate a deep neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

**Key Features**:
- Implemented a neural network with ReLU and Softmax activations.
- Conducted experiments using various batch sizes, learning rates, and regularization techniques (Batch Normalization, L2 Regularization).

## ðŸ‘¥ Project 2: Siamese Network for One-Shot Facial Recognition

**Objective**: Implement a Siamese Neural Network to perform one-shot facial recognition using the LFW-a dataset.

**Key Features**:
- Based on the architecture from *"Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition"* by Koch et al.
- Preprocessing included cropping and resizing images to 105x105, and data augmentation using horizontal flips and rotations.
- Conducted 384 experiments with varying hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, dropout, etc.).

## ðŸŽµ Project 3: Lyric Generation from Melody using LSTM

**Objective**: Generate lyrics from song melodies using an LSTM-based architecture with Word2Vec embeddings and MIDI feature extraction.

**Key Features**:
- Extracted musical features from MIDI files using `pretty_midi`.
- Two feature extraction strategies explored (tempo/chroma vs. instrumentation/duration).
- Lyrics were cleaned and tokenized (Word2Vec embeddings used for word representation).
- Used metrics like Cosine Similarity, Levenshtein Distance, and Polarity to evaluate output quality.
